#My Questions History#

Funny enoughwith all of the obscure things that I have attemped to do with technology and coding in the past I have asked almost no questions on stack over flow. I say almost because of all the problems I have had I have asked one question on the Ruby developer's Reddit.

In college I was attempting to build a personal media server for my senior project and I needed a start on some Github libraries for where to start. My question stated:

- What my problem was
- Why I was doing all of this
- How I wanted to solve it
- Suggestions for what I wanted in an answer
- I didn't want things written for me

I made sure to state that I was doing this for college credit and that I wasn't asking for someone to write any code for me. I think this is good because people will be more helpful if you are looking for a hint for free rather than code for free and I didn't want to run into any issue with plagarizism.

I also made sure to ask for help in a way to not make myself sound too lost or too sure of myself. No one really wants to help either a know-it-all(because if you're asking them the question you most certainly aren't) or a person who has no idea what they are doing. When building a ship it's best not to ask what a ship is, you must do a reasonable amount of research first.

For anyone that gave me a good post I made sure to give them a like/credit for their help and a response to thank them.

Also, if you finish your project or find your answer make sure to post how you resolved it! No one wants to search their own problem and find you had a similar one but never said how you fixed it!
