#Blogging with Jekyll#

I originally was just using a self-made website that I designed earlier in phase-0 but as per request of the curriculum I updated my blog to look more professional and as an option, used Jekyll to accomplish this.

Jekyll is a blog tool that helps maintain homepages, blog posts, and themes. Making vanilla Jekyll websites is super easy as you just have to know how to create it and then start a new post in the right folder with markdown.

There are different themes that you can apply to Jekyll but the one I liked seemed to break my site from running. I was struggling with this and decided it was best to go for my content transfer from my old blog to this new one before I made it pretty. For now my blog is merely functional.
