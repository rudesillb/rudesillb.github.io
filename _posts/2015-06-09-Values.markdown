In my freshman year of college we had to pick a FYS as they called it, a first year seminar. It was a easier class that was supposed to be something you were relatively interested in and mine really shaped how I think. My FYS was called 'A Skeptic's Manifesto' and was about logical falacies, skepticism, and reasoning in logical ways. The professor really inspired me with his knowledge and search for all things truthful. It really matured the way I think and it was really important for myself as a person.

Most of the things that I give advice on have to do with the values and my personality. For the most part I give advice to my friends and family about computers, audio, cars, and music.

While reflecting on these values I get slightly worried that I may only be a voice of facts and not about anything in any grey areas or feelings. I think that my brain probably isn't the best suited for these types of problems but I do try my hardest to be socially concious. Even though I like facts and reason a lot analyzing social situations is something i do a lot in my head anyway.
