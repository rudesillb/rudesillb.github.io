#Hashes Vs. Objects#

Hashes in Ruby and objects in Javascript are very similar. They define a title for the element, an accessor title for each part of that element, and then a value for each of those parts. Javascript objects seem to be a mix of both hashed and method in Ruby as they are used for more functional things rather than just storing data.

#Ruby Hash#

{% highlight ruby %}
myhash = {key1 => 5}
{% endhighlight %}

Javascript Object

{% highlight js %}
myobject = {name: "myobjectname",};
{% endhighlight %}

Classes Vs. Functions

Classes and functions are identical in functionality but different in application and syntax. Ruby classes are very simple that define like:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Myclass
end
{% endhighlight %}

Javascript functions are slightly more verbose

{% highlight js %}
function myFunction(){};
{% endhighlight %}

These functions take up the functionality of Ruby classes and methods. There doesn't really seem to be a one to one correlation between all of the objects but there isn't really any question as to how they work since there are more similarities than differenced.

#Documentation#

The Ruby docs are probably my favorite way of learning about a languages attributes and methods. They are sorted by each object such as strings, arrays, hashes etc. and they list every built in method that you can use on that particular object. They give a quick run down of how it works and a few examples for each method.

Javascript is much the same although the way that they organize it and give examples, in regards to Ruby, seems a little too verbose.
