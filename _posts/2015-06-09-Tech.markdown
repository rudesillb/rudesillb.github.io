##Audio Compression##

#Lossless/Lossy Audio Quality#

Lossless – A compressed version of the audio file that by uncompressing it with the original encoder can be returned to its original uncompressed format.

Common formats - WAV, AIFF, FLAC, Apple Lossless

Lossy – Cannot be returned to its original uncompressed format but
at the advantage of saving space.

Common formats – MP3, AAC, OGG

#Bit Rate/Sample Rate#

Bit Rate - the number of bits (1 or 0) that an encoder is allowed to allocate for each second of audio

Common rates – 128, 192, 256, 320 Kbps

Bit rate can be constant (CBR) or variable (VBR).

Sample Rate – the number of times a second a sample is taken to turn an analog signal into a digital one

Common rates – 44.1, 96, 192, Khz

#How Encoders Work#

Encoders have two basic jobs to complete in order to be successful

Make the file as small as possible and make the file as high quality as possible

They separate the audio by length and frequency

Huffman Coding - a database of frequently used bit strings (must be created per application) is ranked in order of occurrence. This allows the encoder to go down the string of bits and when it can guess the correct one before having to use the ASCII representation number of bits.
