        The idea behind DBC is great because a lot of people go to college and learn a tremendous amount of information but dont really use the majority of it in their line of work. They get to their first job and then learn everything they need to know once they get there. Being able to go to DBC and learn things on a basis of whether or not it is important for a Ruby web developer to know it, is refreshing.

        DevBootcamp wants to create the full package. They want each of their students to learn what it takes to be a Ruby Dev. This may be everything from learning Html, CSS, Ruby, and Rails to understanding how to interect with people in the tech industry to best get things done.

        For myself personally, I am excited about putting myself to work and seeing what I can learn in a few short months. I am however most worried about the group coding aspects of DBC as I come from a college where we mostly coded alone. My expectations havent changed much but i am surely getting more and more nervous to have to code with and in front of people I have never met.
