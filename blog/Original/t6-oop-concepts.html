      <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
      <p>Variable scope is an important tool in any language and allows some variables to be applicable everywhere in a project or just used for an iterator in a single if statement.</p>
      <h2>Constant</h2>
      <p>Constants are designated as:</p>
      <p>VARIABLE = 5</p>
      <p>Constants are just as they sound. They are set at the beginning of a program and are meant to be unchanged. Ruby itself doesn't mind if you change it to something else but it will give you a warning as that isn't what they are designed to do.</p>
      <h2>Global</h2>
      <p>Global variables ar written:</p>
      <p>$global = 5</p>
      <p>Global variables are designed to be across all types of classes or methods and really anywhere in your program</p>
      <h2>Class Variable</h2>
      <p>Class variables are written:</p>
      <p>@@class_variable = 5</p>
      <p>Class variables stay the same through all instances of the class and are usefull for things that don't ever change for your class</p>
      <h2>Instance Variable</h2>
      <p>Instance variables are written:</p>
      <p>@instance_variable = 5</p>
      <p>Instance variables are re-used everytime you create a new instance of the class so if your class is a person the person can be different every time.</p>
      <h2>Local Variable</h2>
      <p>Local variables don't have any special designation and are useful for iteration. Local variables are only good for that particular block of code.</p>
