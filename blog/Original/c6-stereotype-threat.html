      <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
      <p>As a white middle-class male I haven't had much experience with any type of negative stereotypes and am priviledged to not expect to have to prove any of them wrong. As a student that was interesting in psycology since high school, I know that priming someone with negative stereotypes can significantly impact the way that they preform on tests and even can be triggered by simply asking the student their race with out any negative information associated.</p>
      <p>A lot of people seem to be concerned with the "don't offend anyone" culture that seems to becoming popular as of late and I feel stuck in a sensible middle. I think it's important to be inclusive to all people who you interact with until they prove to you that they aren't worth including. I tend to try and be aware of various social situations and be as nice and inclusive as possible but I usually don't try and be an activist about most things, probably due to my propensity to stay out of akward situations. I'm not going to be the one who is picketing on the side walk but if some is being disadvantaged or made fun of in a mean way I will be sure to say something.</p>
      <p>I don't want to be mean or overt in the way that I point things out though. I think quietly pointing someone to a better way of life or way of acting is always the way to go about it. "Yeah, I wouldn't use that word" or "Eh that's not true/nice to say" is always going to be better than yelling at someone for being wrong.</p>
