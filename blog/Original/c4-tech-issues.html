        <h2>Online Security<h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Online security has recently become an issue for the masses because of the prevelance of data collection. With every keystroke, page visit, and e-mail sent there is someone that is collecting data about you. Some types of data collection are less harmful than others but it is up to each tech giant to decide what they are going to collect, how they store it, and who they give it to. Some companies may have your security in mind when creating the standards they operate by, but since the privacy agreements we all agree to are rarely read, the vast majority of people never know which companies are "good" or "bad". Furthermore, most of the times there isn't a clear cut way to tell what you should and shouldn't be concerned about because of the wide variety of opinions that surround computer security. For every person that tells you, "Eh, i wouldn't worry about it if you aren't doing anything wrong", there is a person who says, "Never plug your computer into the internet, ever."</p>
        <h3>Recent Privacy Issues</h3>
            <p>Going one way or the other with data collection and processing can be a tricky matter. Sure it would be easy to just say, "Hey companies, don't do it!" but some tech giants are actually using these powers for the greater good. Google, for instance, uses their mail servers to search through their Gmail users' emails for child pornography. This searching is a more recent application, but it is an easy way to grab the low hanging fruit of child predators and I think, something we can really jump on board with. Some will say that the "don't be worried if you aren't doing anything wrong" argument is weak but considering it isn't storing any information and it is Google doing a search of the files you are storing on THEIR servers already, I can let it pass. Another recent issue with some people is that Microsoft is making it increasingly harder to be able to use each new iteration of Windows with out signing in to their accounts for one reason or another. In their recent release of Windows 10 they ask for your information everywhere; they want you email in order to search with cortana, for Onedrive back ups, and for using their own version of Google Docs(a web client for Office). The big differential between whether this type of connectivity is okay for most people is if you expect it. I expect to need to give some information while buying things or sending emails but I don't expect to have to give it to be able to search the internet (like with Cortana integration in Windows 10).</p>
        <h3>What Can We Do?</h3>
            <p>Like all things technology, you will get back what effort you put into it. If you don't read the license agreements or think about internet privacy much at all you won't have vaery much. If you treat the internet like Area 51 however, you might not ever be seen or recognized. You can't stop websites from taking in data about your browsing habits but you can make their data worthless. A big step toward security on the internet is having a good annonimizing software for your internet connection. Being able to encrypt your connection through a company with a solid reputation for not keeping records is a good first start. If you are interested in such a company Private Internet Access does just the trick and offers very competively priced plans. Second is just knowing what companies your dealing with. Not saying one has to actually read the license agreements but if you check up on what others think of the company and their services in a privacy oriented way, that could be a good start.</p>
