      <h2>Conflict</h2>
      <p>Discuss A Conflict</p>
      <p>College really sparked some extra conflict in my life with having to live with new people and on my own for the first time. With each new roommate is probably something I didn't like about how the person lived their daily life. Freshman year was particularly rough as I had a roommate that was loud and had early classes.</p>
      <p>Source</p>
      <p>I always tried to be courteous when I had early classes and would rarely even cause my roommate to stur in his bed. He however, slammed drawers, closed cabinets, and dropped things as if he knew that he should be more quiet but with out any ability to change anything.</p>
      <p>Emotions/Actions</p>
      <p>Disturbing someones last hour of sleep in the morning seems like maybe not a big deal but like a hot shower or a good cup of coffee in the morning, it's the little things that count. Messing up my routine every morning cause a large amount of ambivelence toward him. He wasn't mean to me in our shared classes and he was a nice guy in general, but man did I hate him for waking me up everymorning. </p>
      <p>Change and Learn</p>
      <p>I never really said anything to him because I figured it hopeless, he's just a loud guy and I can't do anything to change that. The semester is almost over at this point I will just wait it out. He isn't uncourteous in any other sense so it must just be that he is this "sound cluless" in the morning.</p>
      <p>If I could go back and tell him how I felt in the beginning when he started being loud it probably would have made for a better situation. I wouldn't have had to be mean and it could have been as easy as "This is how I open our loud closet doors quietly" or  "Maybe we could just start laying out our clothes so we don't have to look for them in the morning." Anything is better than just not talking about your problems.</p>
