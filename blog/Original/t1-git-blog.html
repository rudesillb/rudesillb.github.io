      Version control is an easy way to save snapshots of your work at intervals. Anytime you are editing files for a project and things stop working for unknown reasons you can always roll back your changes with what you have learned and try again.

      Git allows you to creating experimental branches that you can work on while developing your code in addition to creating the snapshot saves of your current work. This is useful when multiple people are editing your work so when you are ready to commit to your new changes you can easily merge everything back into your master branch. All with your code interfering with each other.

      Working entirely on your own machine is fine if you trust it and don't want anyone else to be able to edit your code, but if you want a convenient place to store and share code Github is great for it.
