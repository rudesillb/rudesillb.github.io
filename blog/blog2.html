        Positioning an element isn't the hardest thing to do, but when you get a larger amount of elements on a page if you don't know exactly what every attribute does, it gets impossible. With margins, padding, and borders you can fine tune your website to look exactly as you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think of a series of picture frames that encompass your element, thats what these three elements look like when you manipulate them. All of the attributes are invisible and that is why it can be tricky to tell the difference between the two.

      <p>
        The first frame that is around your text, picture, or any other HTML attribute it the padding. Padding starts at zero and you can add it if you don't think that you element has enough space around it but inside the border then padding needs to be increased. The border is next and the important thing to remember about the border is that it adds space to an object. When the border is 2px around a square/rectangular object it increases both length and width by 4px. Margins are on the outside of of the border and can be used to increase the space around the border.
